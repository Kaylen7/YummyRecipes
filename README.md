# Yummy Recipes
This is just another Next JS App that fetches data from a Notion database of recipes.
To show page content and style it `NotionToMarkdown` and `MDXRemote` are used.

# Use case
This project was meant to solve two things:
1. Boost access to specific recipes. Notion was taking a lot of time loading the whole database whenever I needed access to just one of the recipes.
2. Access the database with an old device which could not longer have Notion App installed.

# Showcase
I have deployed it in Vercel so feel free to take a look ðŸ˜Š

# Ongoing changes
- Frontend for single page content view.
- Main search optimizing (add filters, similar words,...) in all recipes view.
